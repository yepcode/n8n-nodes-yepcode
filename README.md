![n8n.io - Workflow Automation](https://links.yepcode.io/qwX9S)

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use [YepCode](https://yepcode.io/) in your n8n workflows.

[YepCode](https://yepcode.io/) is an automation platform that connects your services and APIs together with code. It empowers busy development teams to build complex integrations where NoCode tools may not fit: open data streams, huge amounts of information, complex implementation logics, and so on.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
