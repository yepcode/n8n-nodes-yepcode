1. Sign up for [YepCode Cloud](https://cloud.yepcode.io).
2. Get your API token from `Settings > API credentials` in your YepCode workspace.
3. Create your n8n credential using this token.
4. (Optional) Enter a custom API host if using YepCode On-Premise.

## Usage

To use this node, add it to your n8n workflow and configure the required fields, such as selecting the YepCode process or entering your custom code. Make sure your credentials are set up as described above. For more information on using n8n community nodes, see the [n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/#community-nodes).
